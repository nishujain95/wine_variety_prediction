In this dataset, we will predict the wine varities by using reviews description. 

At first, we will clean the data, then we will do some analysis by using matplotlib & seaborn.

After that, we will do predictive modeling.


The Data Description is as follows:  

•	user_name - user_name of the reviewer  
•	country -The country that the wine is from.  
•	review_title - The title of the wine review, which often contains the vintage.  
•	review_description - A verbose review of the wine.  
•	designation - The vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from.  
•	points - ratings given by the user. The ratings are between 0 -100.  
•	price - The cost for a bottle of the wine  
•	province - The province or state that the wine is from.  
•	region_1 - The wine-growing area in a province or state (ie Napa).  
•	region_2 - Sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine-growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley), but this value can sometimes be blank.  
•	winery - The winery that made the wine  
•	variety - The type of grapes used to make the wine. Dependent variable for task 2 of the assignment
